The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack React, FastAPI, and MongoDB application from scratch, addressing evolving user requirements. Initially, a functional frontend was developed using mock data to provide an aha moment. This was followed by the creation of the backend data models and basic API endpoints. A significant pivot occurred when the user requested full Spanish localization, leading to the creation of  components and Spanish mock data. Subsequently, the user requested admin edit capabilities, which were implemented with UI modals and updated admin dashboards. While attempting full backend integration, a Resource not found error occurred. The AI engineer temporarily reverted to using branded mock data to ensure the frontend remained functional, effectively prioritizing user experience over immediate full backend integration. The latest focus has been on comprehensive branding (Axis Peregrinaciones), slogan refinement, and removing all Made with Emergent branding, culminating in preparation for GitHub export, which is the immediate pending action.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a full-stack application for managing pilgrimage itineraries. Key features include: displaying pilgrimage itineraries with daily details, dates, flights, inclusions/exclusions, and biblical quotes; providing interesting facts about destinations; and a Catholic spiritual section featuring Breviary-style content like the Liturgy of the Hours and the Rosary. The application must support client-specific authentication, allowing groups of pilgrims to view shared content. The user will manage itineraries, while the AI is responsible for destination facts and spiritual content. Later requirements included full Spanish localization for all content and UI, and an admin panel with full CRUD capabilities for managing groups, itineraries, and destinations. The branding was explicitly changed to Axis Peregrinaciones, with a specific slogan Tu compa침ero virtual de peregrinaci칩n, and all Made with Emergent branding was to be removed.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with Pilgrim and Admin roles.
- **Data Management**: CRUD operations for pilgrims, groups, itineraries, destinations.
- **UI/UX**: Radix UI/Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling, responsive design.
- **Localization**: Full application support for Spanish language.
- **Development Workflow**: Mock-first frontend, incremental backend integration.

<code_architecture>

- : The main entry point and router for the React application. It dynamically switches between English and Spanish components and mock data based on the development stage. Recently updated to use the integrated/editable and branded components.
-  and : These files contain the mock data used for the initial frontend development and the Spanish localization, respectively. They served as placeholders before full backend integration.
-  (various versions like , , ): These are the core React components for login, pilgrim dashboard, itinerary view, destination facts, spiritual section, and admin dashboard. Multiple versions exist to support English mock, Spanish mock, and integrated backend functionality, and editable admin views.
- : A newly created custom footer component to implement the Axis Peregrinaciones branding and contact information, replacing any default footers.
- : This file handles all API calls from the frontend to the FastAPI backend, abstracting the  requests.
- : Manages authentication state and provides authentication-related functions (login, logout, user info) across the frontend.
- : The main FastAPI application file. It defines API routes ( prefix), includes routers, sets up CORS, and manages the database connection. Significant changes were made to include models, authentication, and CRUD endpoints.
- : Defines the Pydantic models for MongoDB documents (e.g., , , , , ).
- : Handles authentication logic, including JWT token creation and verification.
- : Manages the MongoDB connection and provides functions for database operations.
- : The main HTML file for the React app. Recently modified to remove the Made with Emergent button and update the app's title and meta description for branding.

<pending_tasks>
- Full backend integration to completely replace all mock data across the application.
- Comprehensive backend testing using  for all new and updated endpoints.
- Content management features for administration of prayers and destinations.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of assisting the user with exporting the application to GitHub. The user had specifically requested step-by-step instructions because they could not locate the Save to GitHub button. The AI engineer clarified the location of the button and the process for connecting GitHub and then initiating the export.

Concurrently, the application itself is in a fully functional state, albeit utilizing mock data for most content due to a Resource not found error encountered during a previous attempt at full backend integration. This was a deliberate decision to ensure the app remains usable and displays content without errors while the backend integration issues are addressed.

The application has been extensively branded:
- The main application name is Axis Peregrinaciones.
- The slogan Tu compa침ero virtual de peregrinaci칩n has been implemented consistently across the login page and custom footer.
- All instances of Made with Emergent branding, particularly the persistent button at the bottom right, have been successfully removed, including modifications to .
- A custom footer component () has been created and integrated into the main dashboards, displaying Axis Peregrinaciones contact information, destinations, and a new slogan.

The application currently supports:
- **Login and Admin dashboards** with Axis Peregrinaciones branding.
- **Detailed itinerary view** (8 days for Tierra Santa) using mock data.
- **Spiritual section** and **Destination facts** also relying on mock data for content.
- A fully **responsive UI** with Spanish localization.

Proceed with guiding the user through the GitHub export process now that they can see the Save to GitHub button.
