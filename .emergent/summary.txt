The AI engineer has successfully progressed the Axis Peregrinaciones application from initial setup through significant feature implementations and bug fixes. The journey began with resolving core integration issues like Resource not found errors and backend recursion problems, moving from mock data to real API interactions. Key achievements include a fully functional backend and frontend for groups, destinations, and initial spiritual content. User authentication for both pilgrims and administrators was established, with detailed CRUD capabilities for admin on pilgrimage data. A major recurrent bug, Objects are not valid as a React child during itinerary saving, was systematically debugged and resolved by addressing Pydantic alias inconsistencies, frontend error handling, and missing  fields. Subsequently, admin-only pilgrim registration, including creating, deleting, and modifying pilgrim groups, was fully implemented. The most persistent challenge, an elusive admin login issue despite correct credentials and backend logic, necessitated a temporary frontend bypass for immediate access. Currently, the focus is on enabling the spiritual content section, which is failing to display, likely due to backend model or database configuration issues. The work is iterative, with the AI engineer meticulously addressing user feedback and debugging issues across the stack.

<product_requirements>
The application, branded Axis Peregrinaciones, is a full-stack platform for managing pilgrimage itineraries. It must display detailed daily schedules, flights, inclusions/exclusions, destination facts, and a Catholic spiritual section (Santo Rosario, √Ångelus, daily prayers, Pilgrim's Prayer). It requires client-specific authentication for pilgrim groups and a comprehensive admin panel for CRUD operations on groups, itineraries, and destinations. All content and UI must be in Spanish, with Made with Emergent branding removed.

Recent updates include restricting pilgrim registration to administrators only, removing public signup. Admin login should be hidden from the public UI but accessible via specific credentials. The system needs to ensure pilgrims are assigned to mandatory groups, and their dashboards correctly reflect the assigned group's pilgrimage. Finally, the spiritual content section needs to be fully functional and accessible.

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate and resolve the underlying technical issue preventing the  admin login from working without the temporary frontend bypass.
-   Ensure the  correctly displays the itinerary of the pilgrim's *assigned* group, as the current behavior defaults to Tierra Santa 2025 despite correct backend group assignment.
-   Complete the functionality for the spiritual content section to ensure it is correctly displayed on the frontend, addressing issues related to data parsing or component rendering.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing issues with the spiritual content section. While the spiritual content is confirmed to exist in the database, it is not being displayed correctly on the frontend. Initial investigations revealed an inconsistency in the  Pydantic model (), where  was expected but not present, and  was expected as a dictionary but was provided as a string. This was corrected by adjusting the model definition.

However, after fixing the model, the spiritual content still wasn't displaying. Further debugging revealed a crucial database configuration error in : the application was attempting to connect to  while the  in the  specified . This fundamental mismatch prevented the backend from retrieving the spiritual content correctly. This issue has been fixed by aligning the database name used in  with the one in .

At the very end of the trajectory, the AI engineer was in the process of debugging and rewriting  in the frontend, as it still exhibited syntax errors and issues with displaying the new categories despite the backend fixes. The current state is that the backend can serve the spiritual content, but the frontend component needs final adjustments to correctly display it.
